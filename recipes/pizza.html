        <p>Pizza is all about love. Today we're going to show you how to created a beautiful pepperoni pizza.
            This was a recipe passed down to me through generations and taught to me by my grandmother.
            Each time my brothers and I would go to grandma's house she would create the most gorgeous pie for us to eat.
            Finally one once we were old enough to reach the oven door, grandmother sat us all down and
            taught us how her secret formula.

            <h1>Description</h1>
                <p>Steak is literally the bread and butter of any aspiring cook.  Like my grandfather once told me, "everyone should know how to make a steak!"
                    So I took his advice quite literally and spent many long and tireless nights navigating my way through a kitchen to learn about the best ways to cook
                    a steak.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By the end of this easy to follow tutorial, you'll be able to cook a delicious steak to impress yourself or any other steak lovers in your home.
                    Before we get too far into the details, the one thing you have to remember is that you can always cook your steak longer if you aren't into raw meat.
                    So the next time your grandfather asks for a steak, you can tell em' that you're a certified steak artist.

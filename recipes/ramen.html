            <h1>Description</h1>
                <p>Have you ever wished for a bowl of ramen but didn't have the energy to go out to your favorite
                    ramen bar or simply didn't want to perform the arduous task of creating your own broth and noodles
                    from scratch? Well this was me last Tuesday evening. Just got home from a long day of work and I <strong>NEEDED</strong> my ramen
                    but I also didn't have the time to waste cause the boys were on discord already! Lucky for me I'm an amazing chef,
                    so in a couple minutes I had a delicious bowl of ramen whipped up and ready to be slurped.
                </p>
                <p>Following this simple recipe I've concocted for all you ramen aficionados you'll be able to impress all your pals
                    the next time they come over for a ramen cookout. The best thing about this recipe is that you'll only need a couple veggies, maybe an egg,
                    and finally your favorite flavor of Maruchan's delicious instant ramen.
